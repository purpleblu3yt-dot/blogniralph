        <h1>Favorite Movie</h1>
        <h2>Money Heist</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite movie is Money Heist because it’s full of suspense, clever strategies, <br>
          and unexpected twists that keep me hooked. I admire how the characters aren’t just thieves, 
          but people with deep stories and emotions. <br>
          The way the Professor plans everything with precision makes the story thrilling, and the teamwork, 
          loyalty, and sacrifice shown by <br>
          the group make it more than just a heist—it’s about family and resistance.
